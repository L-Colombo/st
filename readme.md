# Lorenzo Colombo - SUCKLESS'S SIMPLE TERMINAL

This is my build of Suckless's [Simple Terminal](https://st.suckless.org) (ST).
ST is a very fast and minimal terminal emulator built for the X window system.

## Features

My build is, for my use-cases, feature complete.
Unfortunately, I added the patches that I needed without keeping track of them, but i think that the main ones are _undercurl_, _alpha_, _blinkgin cursor_ and _scrollback_.

## Build

To build it suffices clone the repository, navigate in to the directory and run `make && sudo make install`.
